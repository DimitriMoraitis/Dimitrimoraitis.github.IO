    <br>

     <p1> Q: How long have you been investing money for?</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2> A:I personally have been investing in the stock market for five years, However have been investing my clients capital
        for two years now. </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p3> Q: If I need money quickly can I liquidate my portfolio?</p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p4>A: Yes we can. Although it is not recommended especially if you are making serious gains in your portfolio we can
    aid in that process because we care about our clients. In fact we do this at no fee.</p4>
<br>
    <br>
    <p5> Q: Since you are a young investor who charges very low rates, will you steal my money and pull a Ponzi scheme, or any other type of scam?</p5>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p6> A: No certainly not, Dimitri, and his associates are entrepreneur who want to make it high in the industry. They are devoted to keeping a
    fair, legal, and prestigious service for their clients. We want to keep a high reputation so we can grow as a firm.  </p6>
<br>
    <br>
    <p7> Q: What are the differences between a traditional IRA, and a Roth IRA?</p7>
<br>
    <br>
    <p8> A: A very common question among all demographics. In a traditional IRA which is abbreviated for Individual retirement account
    you are investing in a mutual fund that is ran by an individual like me. In that mutual fund we invest in primarily stocks. However the real difference is
    with a traditional IRA you are not taxed until you take your money out of the account. The benefit to that is you'll have more money compounded each time which can
    give you more profits. The other option is a ROTH IRA. With a ROTH IRA you are taxed every time you are given interest however when you decide to take your money out
    you are free of tax. This option can be beneficial if you think taxes in the future will be high. </p8>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p9> Q:Why did you get into investing?</p9>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p10> A: I decided to get into investing because I like the profession. I like helping people succeed financially</p10>
